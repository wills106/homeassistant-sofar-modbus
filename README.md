### It's been decided to turn the solax_modbus Integration into a Universal Solar Modbus Integration supporting different brands of Inverters in a plugin approach.

Please use https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus

The "SolaX" Integration will be renamed at a later date, to a Universal name.
